# Guessing Game (Pokemon Edition)

## What is it?
Guessing Game is just like hangman except we won't be hanging people in this game. Instead, test your knowledge on some of the people that pop-up. 

## How to play?
Start by typing any letter on the keyboard. You will see the image of the pokemon and will have to type its' name. For each incorrect letter, your number of 'Attempts' will decrease until you hit 0 and eventually add a point to your losses. To help you, the letters you have used will be stored under 'Letters Used'. 

Now to win, you will have to guess the pokemons name before your 'Attempts' reach 0. A win will be added to your score and the pokemon will reset and quiz you again.
